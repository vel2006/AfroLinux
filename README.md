# Afro Linux Versions

## What is this branch???

Afro Linux is (currenly) built off of Alpine Linux and is quite simply a reskin of it with some added files and packages. These files being custom to Afro Linux, one of those is "afro.[ext]" which is a very basic package manager for Afro Linux. And, as we all know, a package manager needs to pull from a server to get the packages / programas. So, this is quite simply a branch designed for holding those packages and programs.

## That's good and all, but how do I use this?

Well, our beloved user, you dont (often) directly interact with this branch. This branch is like a database for "afro.[ext]" to get the packages and programs from. The only time you will directly interact with this branch is when you are adding a package to Afro Linux.

## Oh? I can add pacakges, how?

Yes, and no. You can add a package to Afro Linux, only after the package in question has been approved by the main contributor or owner. When it has been aproved it will be added here as a compressed .xz file.
